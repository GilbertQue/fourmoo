# Welcome to Gilbert's Documentation

This site is automatically updated when Word documents are uploaded to Discord!

## How it works

1. Drop a `.docx` file in the `#docs-to-publish` Discord channel
2. The automation converts it to Markdown
3. It gets pushed here automatically
4. GitHub Pages publishes it
